# singapore-residential-prices

*   In land-scarce Singapore, real estate properties prices are sky-high; in fact Singapore 
ranks second among the most expensive residential property markets worldwide, 
after Hong Kong.

*   As such, housing prices may not be so accessible  and house shopping is a big decision 
indeed. Hence we want to be wise when buying a property, be it for own stay or 
future investment.

*   We want to investigate different drivers that may affect Singapore's HDB prices. 
Some possible drivers may be town locations of the HDB flats, proximity to public 
transport MRT train stations, distance from Central (Orchard). This analysis will 
hopefully provide some insights as well as consideration  factors when buying or 
selling your properties. 

*   For the purpose of this project I have opted to do analysis and modelling on HDB flats 
(public housing) as the data is public and readily available,  without having to spend a 
hefty sum on the private property sites for data but the techniques and analysis will 
follow in the similar  fashion.
